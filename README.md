### **Sentiment Analysis on Tweets** üê¶

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using a large dataset to classify them as either **positive** or **negative**.

---

### **Model & Results** ‚ú®

The project uses a **Logistic Regression** model for tweet sentiment classification. This model was trained on a Kaggle dataset to predict sentiment based on the text content of the tweets.

#### **Model Performance**

The Logistic Regression model achieved the following results on the test data:

* **Accuracy:** **82.5%**

### **The Process** ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**: The dataset was loaded and unnecessary columns were removed. The `target` variable was converted to a binary format, where `0` represents **negative** sentiment and `1` represents **positive** sentiment.
2.  **Model Training**: A Logistic Regression model was trained on the preprocessed text data.
3.  **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy and a classification report.
